## Instructions for Obtaining Oracle Jars

Oracle Jars are not installed on public maven servers so they must be manually obtained and installed.

1. Download oracle Jars from Oracle's website. You can usually google for each for the jar files such as "oracle ucp jar" to find the location of each jar file. You need to download `ojdbc6.jar`, `ucp.jar`, and `ons.jar`. Make sure to get the version matching the versions specified in `project.clj`.
2. Put the Jars in `oracle-lib/support`
3. Run `install_oracle_jars.sh` in `oracle-lib/support` which will install the oracle jars in your local maven repository.
